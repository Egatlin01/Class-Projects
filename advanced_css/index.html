        <h3>What is it about?</h3>
            <p>
                Jujutsu Kaisen dives into a world where cursed energy fuels terrifying spirits and the sorcerers who battle them. The story follows Yuji Itadori, a seemingly ordinary student who becomes entangled in the supernatural after consuming a powerful cursed object. What makes the series stand out is its blend of intense action, emotional depth, and a cast of characters who each carry their own burdens and motivations. It’s a universe where strength comes not just from power, but from understanding fear, loss, and the will to keep moving forward

        <h3>How often does it release?</h3>
